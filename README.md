## Problem to solve

Imagine a chess board where each square has a height, forming a topology. Water is poured over the entire board and collects in "valleys" or flows over the edges. What volume of water does a given board hold?

### How does this algorith work?

Image a randomly generated board such as:

```
3, 3, 7, 2, 7, 8, 2, 1
1, 2, 5, 1, 7, 2, 6, 5
7, 8, 3, 7, 8, 8, 2, 6
5, 2, 8, 4, 6, 3, 8, 8
5, 8, 7, 7, 3, 3, 4, 1
2, 6, 6, 1, 1, 5, 3, 3
2, 6, 8, 1, 6, 8, 7, 3
3, 7, 1, 3, 3, 3, 5, 7
```
...where each number represents the height of the square. The steps to (eventually) get the water volume would be:

* Get all the "slices" of empty space (on the X,Y plane)
* We start with level 1 (bottom)
* As you can see, there are 8 empty spaces in here, and 4 of them will flow over the board (**magenta** squares)

* So that means level 1 can hold 4 units of water (**white** squares)
* Now let's see level 2:

* Here we have 6 units of "valid" water, so we add those to the previous ones (10 so far)
* We repeat this addition until we reach a layer with "unstable" water only

## How to distiguish white vs pink water?

Pink water can be "marked" by applying the [Flood Fill algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill), we just need to iterate over the empty spaces on the perimeter of the board. This flood fill won't reach the "valleys" where water can stay.

### Controllers

It's a typical FPS setup:

* WASD to move
* Space to go up
* Shift to go down
* Mouse to rotate camera

Plus:

* Arrow up to raise water
* Arrow down to lower water

### Notes

* If we consider each square is a square inch, then the heights can only be integer inch values, so the total water volume will be an integer amount of cubic inches.

* To run this demo in you machine you need to install LÃ–VE (https://love2d.org/), download the .love file and just click on it

* See rendered-2d.lua, that's where the actual work is done
